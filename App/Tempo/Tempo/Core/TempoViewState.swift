// MARK: - MemoizedTempoSectionedViewState

/// A simplified copy of a `TempoSectionedViewState`, optimized for access to the
/// original view state's sections and the items in each section.
///
/// Using a `MemoizedTempoSectionedViewState` instead of the original view state helps
/// reduce the cost of accessing the `sections` and `items` arrays on the view states.
///
/// These arrays are often implemented as computed properties, which means allocating,
/// deallocating, and force casting the array(s) with each access. In a tight loop, as seen in
/// `CollectionViewAdapter`, this adds up to a noticeable performance issue. This memoized
/// version of the view state accesses the sections/items once, pulling them out for future use
/// through `item(for:)` and `supplementaryItem(for:)` functions.
///
/// - Note: This struct should typically not be used outside Tempo itself.
